# Dinner_Decider
A web application that allows the user to search for a recipe by name or ingredient, and then receive back the recipe with an organized ingredient list, and a relevant youtube video.
 
# Goal
This projects goal was to create an application that solves a real world problem. Our group decided to help provide some extra time to a user by making it easy for them to find a recipe. We did this using HTML, CSS, Javascript, API's, and the CSS framework Bulma. This application features search by name, search by ingredient, and a modal that lets the user select any allergy they may have.
